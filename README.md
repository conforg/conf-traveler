# Conf Traveler

As a conference organiser we have to deal with a lot of things, one of them is tracking when and where speakers are arriving and how to arrange pickup for them. This tool tries to replace the spreadsheets used by many conference organisers to schedule arrivals and plan drivers.

## TrueNorthPHP 2014

We also want to display this tool as part of the [TrueNorthPHP Conference 2014](http://truenorthphp.ca) hackathon, even though it will be hacked together without the proper testing (sorry Chris) in it's initial, prototype state.

## Roadmap

Get a PoC out for the TrueNorthPHP Hackathon and work on it along the way.

Initial goals:

- incorporate a list of airports (API of tripit or another service?)
- incorporate a list of speakers (API of joindin???)
- make a nice dashboard for web and mobile

Optional goals:

- oauth authentication using meetup and/or joindin
